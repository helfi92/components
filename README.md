## Development and Contributing

To get started:

Open a browser to http://localhost:6060 to preview the React components.
- Use CTRL-C to exit the styleguide.
- Use `yarn build` to generate the compiled component for publishing to npm.

Feel free to open an issue, submit a pull request, or contribute however you would like. Understand that this
